# Weighting survey data with generalized raking algorithm
Python algorithm using generalized raking to weight a data without need to define multivariate distributions.

*generalized_raking.py* contains all the methods as well as simple example.

The algorithm is described in the article on [my webpage](https://palasmi.github.io/projekt_weights.html "Generalized Raking Algorithm").
